	 * important and interesting topic is serialization: 
	 * first why serialization is required : 
	 * a class implements serialization means we can serialize it. i.e not but we can transfer the objects 
	 * byte by byte to either file or netwrk.but serialization purpose is to keep the object structure unchnage.
	 * once the object receviced on the other side again it rebuilds its original structure.
	 * 
	 * if we want to avoid our class from serialization is make it transit.
	 * i.e nothing but we can not make our class serializable.
