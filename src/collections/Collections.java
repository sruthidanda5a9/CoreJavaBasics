	/*
	 * collection  :  any thing which stores the data and iterates throught it is a collection.
	 * Collection : This is the interface except maps every colection
	 *  implements this Collection interface.contains add,remove , removeall methods.(all basic methods)
	 * Collections : This is a class which contains all the methods which are used by collection.
	 * 
	 *   collections  :  
	 *   
	 *   1) list : duplicate elements , elements ordered with index value.
	 *   		
	 *   		a)arraylist : order , non synchronized.
	 *   because of order with index iteration is easy . if we want to iterate very fast use arraylist insted of linked list .
	 *    but here in array list insertion and deletion are very difficult.time tacking.
	 *   		b)vector : sysnchronized.
	 *   		3)linked list: here like arraylist all the elements ordered and  are doubly linked.because of this iteration is slow and
	 *   		insertion deletion in to linked list is fast.
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   2)set : unique elements
	 *   		
	 *   		a)hash set : these are un sorted and un ordered . here we use hash code to access the elements.
	 *   use this hash if we don't care about the order of iteration and we don't want duplicate values.
	 *   		b)linked hash set :same as hash set but here all the elements are doubly linked and .
	 *   use this if we want to iterate in an specific order with unique elements. (BY INSERTION ORDER)
	 *   		c)tree set :
	 *  
	 *   
	 *   3)map : unique value pair.
	 *   		a)hash map : same as hash set but here the elemnts are 
	 *   key value pairs with the hash code we will access the elemnts.
	 *   		
	 *   		b)linked hash map
	 *   		
	 *   		c)hash tree :
	 *   this is sorted with the elements.	    		
	 *   		d)hash table : same as vector . hash table is synchronized.
	 *   difference of hash table with hash map is : hash table is sysnchronized and it will not allow null keys.
	 *   but the hash map will allow many null values and one null key.(keys should be unique)
	 *   
	 *   4)queue
